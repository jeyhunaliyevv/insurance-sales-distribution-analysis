# Insurance Sales Distribution Analysis (Anonymized)

## Overview
This project analyzes insurance sales to identify:
- which companies generate the highest sales,
- which customer segments/channels drive revenue,
- and how sales are distributed across key dimensions.

## Key Questions
- Top companies by total premium/sales
- Sales distribution by customer segment and sales channel
- Company share and concentration (Pareto)

## What’s Included
- Summary tables (top companies, segment/channel breakdown)
- Visualizations (bar charts, Pareto, heatmaps)
- Actionable insights (3–5 key findings)

## Data Note
The original dataset is proprietary. This repository uses anonymized/synthetic data with the same schema to demonstrate the full workflow.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook "insurance_sales_distribution_analysis.ipynb"
